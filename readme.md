# 🔐 AuthFlow Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a dual-backend authentication system using a React (Vite + TS) frontend with Node.js (Express) and Go backends. It aims to provide a secure, modular, and scalable authentication mechanism that can switch between backend services and display real-time system status to the user.

| Layer     | Tech Stack                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React + TypeScript (Vite)                  |
| Backend   | Node.js (Express), Go (net/http)           |
| Auth      | JWT (httpOnly cookies), Argon2/Bcrypt      |
| Misc      | ULID, Helmet, CORS, Rate-Limit             |

## 🔁 Auth Flow

1. **Login Attempt**  
    User enters credentials into the login form.  
    A POST request is sent to `/api/login` on the first available backend (3000 for Node, 8080 for Go).  
    If credentials match (username + password), a JWT is generated and sent as an httpOnly cookie.

2. **JWT Cookie Handling**  
    JWTs are stored in httpOnly cookies to protect against XSS.  
    Cookies include:  
    - `secure` (true in production)  
    - `sameSite: 'lax'`  
    - `maxAge: 3600` (1 hour)

3. **Auto-Login / Protected Routes**  
    On mount, the frontend pings `/api/protected` on both backends.  
    If a valid token is present, the user is redirected to `/page1`.  
    If not, the user remains on the login page.

4. **Status Bar**  
    Frontend pings both ports and checks which backend is responding.  
    Shows the active service and backend info (language, framework, port, hash algo, jwt method, ULID usage, environment).

## 🔐 Security Measures

| Measure                | Implemented In   | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Argon2id Hashing       | Node (argon2)    | Passwords hashed using Argon2id before comparison                  |
| Plain comparison       | Go               | Go backend uses dummy plaintext (can be replaced with Argon2id/Bcrypt) |
| JWT with Expiry        | Both             | Token expires in 1 hour                                            |
| Secure httpOnly Cookie | Both             | Prevents client-side JS access to the token                        |
| Helmet + CORS + Rate Limit | Node         | Prevents common attacks (headers + spam + CSRF resilience)         |
| CORS + credentials     | Both             | Allows cookie-based auth from the frontend (port 5173)             |

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Redundancy:** Two backend services offer failover or hybrid deployment.
- **Transparency:** Real-time info shown to users via StatusBar.
- **Scalability:** Directory structure and modular code allow service expansion.
- **Security-first:** Uses industry best practices for password hashing, cookie flags, rate limiting, and content security.
